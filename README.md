# SPE_Proj1_2019
First project of the course Simulation and Performance Evaluation AA 2018/2019

The aim is to decode a secret phrase using the given mappings sample->character, in which samples are taken from different gamma distrubutions (unknown parameters) and multiplied by `1` or `-1`.
All the details are in the file `assignment_1.pdf`.

The code now solves all the tasks assessed in the project specification.
It also produces some useful plots and generates csv that can be used to produce Latex tables.

The final report is `report.pdf`.
